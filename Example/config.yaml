# RabbitMQ Configuration for Stage 2 - Complete Example
# This configuration demonstrates all functionality:
# - Multiple consumers with different formats (JSON and YAML)
# - Different RabbitMQ servers (ports 5672 and 5673)
# - Consuming from both queues and exchanges
# - Publishing to both queues and exchanges

consumers:
  # Consumer 1: JSON format from RabbitMQ queue on port 5672
  - endpoint: amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/queue1
    format: json
    sourceType: queue
  # Consumer 2: YAML format from RabbitMQ exchange on port 5673
  - endpoint: amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5673/exchange1
    format: yaml
    sourceType: exchange

output:
  # Output configuration - publish to exchange
  endpoint: amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/output.exchange
  format: json
  destinationType: exchange
